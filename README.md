# DLND TV Script Generation

## Submission for Udacity DLND Project 3

A Recurrent Neural Network built with TensorFlow for generating a new Simpson TV Script using LSTM cells.  
Based off [Simpsons dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data) of scripts from 27 seasons.


### Sample Script Generated:

homer_simpson:(sobs) what do you think?  
homer_simpson:(smoothly) i'll have you know, i wrote it down.  
homer_simpson:(distraught) don't tell my kids i'm going to jail! tell them i've joined the blue man group! i'm the fat one!
moe_szyslak:(quietly) no, i think i was just using it as a compliment!(chuckle) three beers, please!  
homer_simpson:(sweet) yeah.  
homer_simpson:(surprised) really? you think it's dangerous?  
moe_szyslak: oh, yeah.
